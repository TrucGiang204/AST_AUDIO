## Overview
Automated respiratory sound classification faces practical challenges from background noise and insufficient denoising in existing systems. We propose **A**daptive **D**ifferential **D**enoising network for **R**espiratory **S**ounds **C**lassification (**ADD4RSC**), that integrates noise suppression and pathological feature preservation via three innovations: 1) **Adaptive Frequency Filter** with learnable spectral masks and soft shrink to eliminate noise while retaining diagnostic high-frequency components; 2) A **Differential Denoise Layer** using differential attention to reduce noise-induced variations through augmented sample comparisons; 3) A **bias denoising loss** jointly optimizing classification and robustness without clean labels. Experiments on the ICBHI2017 dataset show that our method achieves `65.53%` of the Score, which is improved by `1.99%` over the previous sota method.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started



### 1. ðŸ“¦ Download and prepare audio data
- **Download**: ICBHI 2017 Respiratory Sound Database [Official Challenge Page](https://bhichallenge.med.auth.gr/ICBHI_2017_Challenge)
- **Characteristics**:
  - 126 subjects with real-world recordings
  - Contains heart sounds, ambient noise, and transducer artifacts
  - Sampling rates: 4kHz-44.1kHz â†’ resampled to 16kHz


### 2. ðŸ¤– Download pre-trained model
You can download the pretrained AST model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593).


### 3. ðŸ§  Start training
Our code is based on PyTorch. Please install these required packages from their official sources. We include our versions below for reference, but other versions might also work.

```
# Main packages for training
pytorch=2.0.1
cuda=11.7
torchaudio=2.0.1
```
