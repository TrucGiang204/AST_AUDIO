## Overview
This repository contains the official implementation of the **Adaptive Differential Denoising (ADD)** network for robust respiratory sound classification. The method integrates three key innovations:

1. **Adaptive Frequency Filter (AFF)**  
   - Learns spectral masks with soft shrink: `SŒ±(x) = sign(x) max{|x| - Œ±, 0}`
   - Preserves diagnostic high-frequency components while eliminating noise

2. **Differential Denoise Layer (DDL)**  
   - Uses Multi-Head Differential Attention (MHDA) mechanism
   - Suppresses noise through contrastive augmented views
   - Implements:  
     `A = [œÉ(Q‚ÇÅK‚ÇÅ·µÄ/‚àöd) - Œª¬∑œÉ(Q‚ÇÇK‚ÇÇ·µÄ/‚àöd)]V`

3. **Bias Denoising Loss**  
   - Jointly optimizes classification and denoising
   - Uses label smoothing: `L = -Œ£[y_c(1-Œµ) + Œµ/C]¬∑log[œï(Norm(p))]`
   - No clean labels required

**Key Results**:
- üèÜ **65.53% Score** on ICBHI 2017 (SOTA)
- üìà **+1.99%** improvement over previous best
- üîç **85.13% Specificity (Sp)** | **45.94% Sensitivity (Se)**
